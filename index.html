<p>This site is gonna be grammatically incorrect and I am sorry for that</p>
<i>i mean i am still considering using lowercase text-transform in the body.</i>
<i>Check the CSS...</i>

<p>This page can presumably be combined with the about page? Idk</p>

<p>What should be on this website? I want to talk about computer minimalism. I want to be able to link to the homebrew CPU ring (once I get that project going) and also the 256k ring. I want the site to be findable on <a href="https://wiby.me">wiby</a> but I don't care about anywhere else.</p>
<p>I would like to link to my friends' websites and have very small amounts of CSS on here. Currently at 5 custom attributes.</p>
<p>I want all of the content from my uni website but also much more cozy vibes. Maybe kinda vague tumblr vibes but less structured</p>
