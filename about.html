  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
  I want this site to be under 256KB in size (with smaller goals wherever possible).
  The smaller a site is, the faster it loads. Whether that is 'in a reasonable amount of time' when you have (relatively) slow internet access or 'effectively instantly' when you measure your internet speed in Mbps.
  The main thing holding it back is images. Currently there are only 3, averaging around 30KB each but that is still the vast majority of the content of this site.
  The text portion of this website is very small - as is pretty typical of text data.
  </p>

  I'm still working out how best to do images - 1-bit black and white is great but doesn't work in all cases (<a href="/images/planck_wiring.png">this image</a> is ruined by 1-bit greyscale).
  The styling is also unfinished - an auto dark mode that doesn't use much CSS text would be great.
  This current version of the website is entirely hand-written HTML because frankly if I can write a dissertation in LaTeX then I can quite comfortably use a bit of HTML.
  However this does make some of the management a bit annoying. I'll probably switch it to a statically-built site using cat and make like I did with the last version of the site.
